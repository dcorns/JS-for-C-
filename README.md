Some JS string that can be used with C# javascriptresult()

I used these strings in a large application I have been developing. They may be useful to others, however be advised that many of them may need to be monified for your application as some are expecting variables to be present, and others are pulling data from the server in order to complete the Js code that is ultimately returned.

If I have time I intend to look into removing dependencies in order to make the code more portable.
